Many thanks.

The OWCoSOD datasets (OWCoSal, OWCoSOD, OWCoCA) can be downloaded from the link https://pan.baidu.com/s/11MKqPIRP58p8lvz7x9AF2Q, and the password is 1310.

The results of our method on OWCoSal, OWCoSOD, OWCoCA can be downloaded from https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Yw3jN_cxkRgR47PSiIclPw, the password is 1310.

# Co-Salient Object Detection with Uncertainty-aware Group Exchange-Masking

The results of our method on CoSal2015, CoSOD3k, CoCA, MSRC, and iCoseg are available, and they can be downloaded from the link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1uRwH5Y1HgDvxWd9gwRoR9g, and the password is 1310.

The pretrained_model and weights can be downloaded from the link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1_FVoR6QP6FeQCZEGxgyZog and the password is 1310.

Putting the pretrained_model into ./pretrained_model and weights files into ./result/models and run coseg_test.py can get the results.

The link of the eval toolbox is: https://github.com/zzhanghub/eval-co-sod, we are very grateful for their contributions.
