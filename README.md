Many thanks.

The results of our method on CoSal2015, CoSOD3k, CoCA, MSRC and iCoseg are available, and they can be download from the anonym link: https://anonymfile.com/z8A90/results.zip.

The pretrained_model and weights can be download from the anoym link: https://anonymfile.com/BXaQp/weights.zip.

Putting the pretrained_model into ./pretrained_model and weights files into ./result/models and run coseg_test.py can get the results.

The link of the eval toolbox is: https://github.com/zzhanghub/eval-co-sod, we are very grateful for their contributions.
